# Log of Dualboot Project

## Instructions for Codex
- See Readme first for writing instructions.
- Log data here extensively such that at any time, you will know what stage of the project we are at, what has been done, etc.
- This file is all yours, although I may add a few things here and there. Otherwise, use this as your memory.
- The section below is the log. You may format it however you like. Be SURE to read the ENTIRE README.md before beginning.
